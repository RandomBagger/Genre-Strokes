## **Gameplay**

1. **Tagging:**  
   First, tag the materials with appropriate tags that you see fit.

2. **Main Game:**  
   After all materials are tagged, you will be redirected to the main game page, where you will guess the tags assigned to the game materials.

3. **Scoring:**  
   We track the score in the background to keep the pressure off the player (as studies show that visible score increases stress!).

4. **Challenge:**  
   The higher your score, the lower the visibility! üòÅ
